## 🚀 Deployment Considerations

### Development

- Strapi runs locally on port 1337
- React app uses `http://localhost:1337`
- SQLite database (default)
- Local file storage for uploads

### Production

- **Strapi**:

  - Deploy to Heroku, Railway, DigitalOcean, or AWS
  - Use PostgreSQL or MySQL database
  - Configure cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary)
  - Set up HTTPS
  - Update CORS settings

- **React App**:

  - Update `VITE_STRAPI_URL` to production URL
  - Secure API token in environment variables
  - Build and deploy to hosting service

- **Firebase**:
  - Already cloud-based
  - Configure Firestore security rules
  - Set up proper indexes
